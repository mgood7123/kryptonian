HELP IN THIS GAME'S DEVELOPEMENT WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED

ALPHA

Super-Man Game

Made in Unreal Engine 4.20

the game will be heavily based on superman, but set far in the future, like probably the year 5630 or something

but i am willing to change aspects of my game if required

nothing is actually done yet, as i am focusing on the powers and effects first, then i'll start creating combat and AI, and eventually levels


i am aiming for a realistic experience as apposed to non realistic experience and this is the closest i can find to a realistic version of the Freeze Breath (except the actual gust itself at the end passes through enemies instead of colliding with them but other than that it looks almost perfect)


so far i have the following powers implemented

Super-Speed True version

where the character actually slows down the world around them but moves at or near normal speed


Super-Speed Alternative Version

where the character moves fast and the world remains normal speed


this variation of Super-Speed would immensely hinder character movement in tight spaces when moving super fast as the player cannot react to such speeds and would likely collide with almost everything trying to navigate, and thus would only be useful for wide areas such as a long highway or an area with extremely few obstacles for the player to collide with as the player will not want to spend an hour traveling across, for example, the desert, in Super-Speed so in-game it takes them 1 second but in reality it takes them 1 hour to cross the desert, as they probably want to be able to cross it in say 5 seconds instead of 1 hour, and so on


Heat Vision


Flight


Freeze Breath (has a horrible non realistic animation, which i want to improve)
